## Adopt our cat of the month: Pounce!

![Pounce](/images/pounce.jpg)

Pounce is a very pretty young male cat with the softest fur in the world. He loves to be snuggled and brushed and will purr just because he's around you! He's a little shy but once he decided you're his friend he's always excited to see you. He loves to chase his toys and jump around, he's really fast!


## About

Whiskers of Hope, Inc. is a non-profit no-kill adoption organization for cats and kittens. We are an all-volunteer 501(c)3 not-for-profit charitable corporation. We operate a no-kill "virtual shelter" with all our cats in the care of foster homes.

Whiskers of Hope needs your help and is always looking for volunteers that would like to foster homeless cats. Fostering can be a very rewarding experience! For more information contact our Adoption Coodinator at: 781.648.4095, or e-mail whiskers@whiskersofhope.org.

We rely on the support of caring individuals to feed and get medical care of our cats. All donations are greatly appreciated and are tax deductible. Donations can be sent to our PO Box.

## Adopt a Cat or Kitten

All cats and kittens for adoption have been examined by a veterinarian, spayed or neutered, vaccinated against rabies and distemper (FVRCP), dewormed, treated to prevent fleas and mites, and tested for feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus (FeLK/FIV).

We ask for a contribution of $125 for one cat or $200 for two cats as an adoption fee to recover the cost of this care.

## The Adoption Process

Adopting a cat will enrich your life, but it's a lifelong commitment that deserves careful consideration. We require a completed adoption application to start the adoption process. Adoption applications can be submitted on paper in person, or online. We will require a couple of days to process your application and confirm your references.

When your application is approved you will meet with the Whiskers of Hope, Inc. adoption coordinator and visit with the cat or kitten a couple of times until you both feel comfortable together. In some cases a home visit may also be required.

Please note that kittens (under 9 months of age) are only adopted in pairs unless you already have a cat or dog at home for company.

## Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)- What is it?

* FIV causes decreased immune function and increased susceptibility to infections and diseases in cats
* Humans are NOT at risk for FIV infection
* Transmitted mainly through bite wounds, not through normal social activities such as grooming
* Non-FIV infected cats in the same household are at low risk for infection but it is recommended that FIV+ cats do not join household with FIV- cats or are kept separate
* FIV+ cats should be spayed/neutered and kept indoors to prevent infection to other cats
* There is no cure for FIV, but infected cats may live many years symptom-free
* Regular vet check-ups, a nutritionally balanced diet, and a close watch for symptoms of illness with prompt treatment help to increase the FIV+ cat’s quality and longevity of life
